# Lambda Calculus: CEK Machine

This is an implementation of the lambda calculus that is based off of a live 
coding session given by Ed Kmett located 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwD7D7XUzec). I made a type
checker for it and made it work with a given primitive type and a given
set of primitive binary operations.
